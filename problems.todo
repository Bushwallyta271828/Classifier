 Allow "blurry edges" for the aperture - i.e. some of the star's photons may be hitting outside the aperture, so give those neighboring pixels SOME weight.
 Use a Bayesian approach to finding the probability / weight of the pixels on the blurry edge.
 re-write the "Dynamic Writeup.pdf" file to correct for the <1/x> \neq 1/<x> issue.
 Explain why I'm using this todo and not using Issues.
