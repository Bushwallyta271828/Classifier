This repository is currently (close to) a copy of my Dynamic2 repository. I will update soon(ish) with details on what on earth is going on.
Note: Instead of using the Issues feature of github (which I find annoying to use), I'm using my own file to record what I'm doing: issues.todo. The ".todo" file extension is an extension that I've made up, but for me it represents a list of things to do. A hashtag in front of an item means that the item is complete. A percent sign in front of an item means that I didn't technically do it, but I no longer have to. A space in front of an item means that I haven't done it yet.
